# AnalysisAndDesign

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem was to create a program that can take a csv file containing college course information and store the courses into a data structure that can be searched, sorted, and printed. I had to analyze the run-time of a vector, hash map, and binary tree to choose the best data structure to use.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I created psuedocode for each data structure to understand how each would function in the application. I then performed a runtime analysis of each structure to figure out whic woould be best. For what was required from the program I determined that a vector would be the best data structure to use. I then created the program, using the psuedocode I hade created previously.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The roadblocks I had were related to programming in C++ as I don't have a lot of familiarity with it. I used the documentation and various web sources to figure out any problems I was having with the language.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I now understand how the different data structures we use in our programs can be very important, expecially when scaled to a much larger project. Analyzing the structures and functionality of the program and choosing the most appropriate data structures is crucial to creating efficient programs.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
As I work on projects in the future I will be sure to consider each data structure I am using and how it is affecting the programs efficiency. I will spend more time during the design phase doing analysis since I now understand how important it is.
